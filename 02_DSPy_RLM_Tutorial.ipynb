    "\n",
    "[DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) is a framework for **programming with language models**, not just prompting them. Key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signatures**: Declarative specifications of input/output (e.g., `\"context, query -> answer\"`)\n",
    "- **Modules**: Composable building blocks (Predict, ChainOfThought, ReAct, RLM)\n",
    "- **Optimizers**: Automatic prompt tuning and few-shot learning\n",

    "### What is RLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursive Language Models (RLMs)** solve the context length problem by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Storing the context as a variable in a code execution environment\n",
    "2. Letting the LLM write Python code to explore and analyze the context\n",
    "3. Enabling recursive sub-LLM calls via `llm_query()` on specific chunks\n",
    "4. Iterating until the model produces a final answer via `SUBMIT()`\n",

      "SUMMARY:\n",
      "Jealousy is the central theme in William Shakespeare's *Othello*, driving the narrative toward tragedy and significantly influencing the relationships between characters. Othello's insecurities are exploited by Iago, leading to his intense jealousy, which distorts his perception of reality and fosters mistrust, ultimately resulting in catastrophic consequences. The theme explores the destructive power of jealousy, exemplifying how it can corrupt and ruin the lives of those it touches.\n",

      "- Jealousy as a driving force: It propels the actions of Othello and culminates in tragic outcomes.\n",
      "- Manipulation by Iago: Iago's deceit exploits Othello's insecurities about Desdemona's fidelity, showing how jealousy can be artificially ignited.\n",
      "- Destructive consequences: The repercussions of jealousy lead to a breakdown of trust, betrayal, and violence among characters, illustrating its devastating impact.\n"

      "In Shakespeare's \"Hamlet,\" five key themes underpin the narrative: revenge, madness, mortality, corruption, and truth versus deception. The quest for vengeance propels Hamlet into a moral quandary, while his feigned madness reveals the fragility of sanity, impacting those around him tragically. The exploration of mortality prompts deep existential questions, particularly in Hamlet's introspective soliloquies. The theme of corruption illustrates the decline of Denmark’s moral integrity through Claudius's actions, reflecting the personal decay experienced by characters. Lastly, the struggle for truth amid pervasive deceit illustrates a world where clarity is elusive. These interconnected themes collaboratively illuminate the complexities of the human experience, ultimately guiding the play's tragic trajectory.\n"
